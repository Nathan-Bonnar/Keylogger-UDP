This is a program I made a little bit ago
The program works by setting a gloabal hook intercepting any keydata, the data gets sent via UDP to a server
The server recives the packet and displays it
This project is a personal project for research and experimentation ONLY
I made this to invistigate setting windows hooks and sending data via UDP to a server via the winsock DLL
