This is a program I made a little bit ago
The program works by setting a global hook intercepting any key data, the data gets sent via UDP to a server.
The server receives the packet and displays it
This project is a personal project for research and experimentation ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I made this to investigate setting windows hooks and sending data via UDP to a server via the Winsock DLL
